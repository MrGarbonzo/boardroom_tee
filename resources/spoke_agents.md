## Agent Collaboration Protocols

### Request Routing Pattern
```
1. Agent receives user query
2. Determines if collaboration needed
3. Requests hub to identify relevant specialists
4. Hub returns list of capable agents
5. Agent requests specific analysis from colleagues
6. Hub verifies attestation and brokers communication
7. Requesting agent synthesizes results
```

### Collaboration Examples

**CEO Query: \"Should we acquire Company X?\"**
```
CEO Agent → Finance Agent: \"Analyze valuation and financial impact\"
CEO Agent → Legal Agent: \"Review due diligence requirements\"
CEO Agent → Technology Agent: \"Assess integration complexity\"
CEO Agent → Sales Agent: \"Evaluate market and customer impact\"
CEO Agent: Synthesizes all insights into acquisition recommendation
```

**Marketing Query: \"Optimize Q4 ad spend\"**
```
Marketing Agent → Finance Agent: \"What's available Q4 marketing budget?\"
Marketing Agent → Sales Agent: \"Which channels drive highest-value leads?\"
Marketing Agent: Combines budget constraints with lead quality data
```

### Context Preservation
- **Chain of reasoning**: Each agent receives previous analysis context
- **Attribution tracking**: Know which agent provided each insight
- **Confidence scoring**: Weight recommendations by agent expertise
- **Conflict resolution**: Handle disagreements between specialists

## Agent Development Framework

### Base Agent Template
```python
class BaseAgent:
    def __init__(self, domain_expertise, model_config):
        self.domain = domain_expertise
        self.model = load_specialized_model(model_config)
        self.crypto_keys = load_tee_keys()
        self.hub_client = HubClient(self.crypto_keys)
    
    def process_query(self, query):
        # Determine data needs
        data_request = self.analyze_data_requirements(query)
        
        # Request data from hub
        data = self.hub_client.request_data(data_request)
        
        # Check if collaboration needed
        collaboration_needs = self.assess_collaboration_needs(query, data)
        
        if collaboration_needs:
            # Request insights from other agents
            colleague_insights = self.request_collaboration(collaboration_needs)
            return self.synthesize_response(query, data, colleague_insights)
        else:
            return self.analyze_independently(query, data)
```
