# Agent-to-Agent Collaboration Protocol

## Overview
The agent-to-agent collaboration system enables spoke agents to work together dynamically, providing multi-specialist analysis without the overhead of fixed pipeline processing.

---

## Core Innovation

### Dynamic Specialist Networks
Unlike traditional fixed pipelines, agents can form temporary collaboration networks based on the specific question being asked.

**Key Advantages**:
- **On-demand expertise**: Only relevant specialists are involved
- **Flexible workflows**: Natural conversation flow adapts to business questions
- **Cost efficiency**: Pay only for agents actually used
- **Infinite scalability**: Add new specialists without rebuilding core architecture

### Collaborative Intelligence Model
```
Traditional: Question → Fixed Pipeline → Answer
Boardroom TEE: Question → Dynamic Agent Network → Collaborative Answer
```

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Agent Registry System
**Purpose**: Hub maintains real-time registry of agent capabilities and status

**Registry Structure**:
```json
{
  "agents": {
    "cfo-agent-client-123": {
      "capabilities": ["financial_analysis", "budget_planning", "risk_assessment"],
      "specialties": ["cash_flow", "profitability", "compliance"],
      "instance_size": "medium",
      "status": "active",
      "attestation_status": "verified",
      "last_seen": "2025-07-23T14:30:00Z",
      "performance_metrics": {
        "avg_response_time": 8.5,
        "success_rate": 0.96,
        "collaboration_score": 0.89
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Capability Discovery**:
- Natural language capability matching
- Expertise confidence scoring
- Workload and availability tracking
- Performance-based routing

### 2. Request Routing Engine
**Purpose**: Intelligent routing of collaboration requests between agents

**Routing Algorithm**:
```python
def route_collaboration_request(query, requesting_agent, available_agents):
    # Parse query for required expertise
    required_skills = extract_required_expertise(query)
    
    # Score agents by capability match
    agent_scores = []
    for agent in available_agents:
        capability_match = calculate_capability_match(required_skills, agent.capabilities)
        availability_score = calculate_availability(agent.current_load)
        performance_score = agent.performance_metrics.collaboration_score
        
        total_score = (capability_match * 0.5 + 
                      availability_score * 0.3 + 
                      performance_score * 0.2)
        
        agent_scores.append((agent, total_score))
    
    # Return top-ranked available agent
    return max(agent_scores, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```

### 3. Multi-Hop Attestation
**Purpose**: Ensure security throughout agent collaboration chains

**Attestation Flow**:
```
1. Agent A requests collaboration from Hub
2. Hub verifies Agent A's attestation status
3. Hub identifies target Agent B for collaboration
4. Hub verifies Agent B's attestation status
5. Hub brokers secure connection between A and B
6. Agents exchange data using verifiable message signing
7. Hub logs all interactions for audit trail
```

**Security Guarantees**:
- All agents in chain verified before communication
- End-to-end encryption using TEE-generated keys
- Complete audit trail of all collaboration requests
- Automatic termination of chains with failed attestation

## Collaboration Patterns

### 1. Sequential Analysis Pattern
**Use Case**: Complex questions requiring multiple specialist perspectives

**Flow Example - M&A Analysis**:
```
CEO Agent: "Should we acquire Company X?"
    ↓
Finance Agent: "Analyze valuation and financial impact"
    ↓ (passes financial context)
Legal Agent: "Review due diligence with financial constraints"
    ↓ (passes financial + legal context)
Technology Agent: "Assess integration complexity with deal structure"
    ↓ (passes all previous context)
Sales Agent: "Evaluate market impact with integration timeline"
    ↓
CEO Agent: Synthesizes all specialist inputs into recommendation
```

**Context Accumulation**:
- Each agent receives full context from previous specialists
- Context includes analysis, confidence scores, and reasoning
- Final synthesis considers all perspectives and constraints

### 2. Parallel Consultation Pattern
**Use Case**: Independent analysis from multiple specialists simultaneously

**Flow Example - Strategic Planning**:
```
CEO Agent: "Analyze Q4 strategic priorities"
    ↓ (parallel requests)
    ├── Finance Agent: "Financial constraints and opportunities"
    ├── Marketing Agent: "Market opportunities and competitive threats"
    ├── Sales Agent: "Revenue pipeline and growth potential"
    └── Operations Agent: "Operational capacity and constraints"
    
CEO Agent: Synthesizes parallel insights into strategic priorities
```

**Conflict Resolution**:
- Identify contradictory recommendations between specialists
- Weight recommendations by agent expertise and confidence
- Propose hybrid solutions when specialists disagree
- Flag areas requiring human decision-making

### 3. Iterative Refinement Pattern
**Use Case**: Collaborative problem-solving with back-and-forth analysis

**Flow Example - Budget Optimization**:
```
CFO Agent: "Optimize Q4 budget allocation"
    ↓
Marketing Agent: "Request $500K for holiday campaign"
    ↓
CFO Agent: "Budget constraint: $300K marketing available"
    ↓
Marketing Agent: "Revised proposal: $300K focused on top channels"
    ↓
Sales Agent: "Lead capacity can handle increased volume"
    ↓
CFO Agent: "Approved - monitor ROI metrics"
```

**Iterative Features**:
- Multiple rounds of analysis and refinement
- Constraint propagation between specialists
- Collaborative solution development
- Consensus building with compromise solutions

    "constraints": ["budget_limit: $300K"],
    "deadline": "high_priority"
  },
  "query": "Analyze ROI for proposed $300K holiday marketing campaign",
  "collaboration_type": "sequential|parallel|iterative"
}
```

### 2. Response Format
**Standard collaboration response structure**:
```json
{
  "response_id": "uuid-v4",
  "request_id": "uuid-v4",
  "responding_agent": "marketing-agent-client-123",
  "analysis": {
    "findings": "Holiday campaign projected 4.2x ROI based on historical data",
    "confidence_score": 0.87,
    "supporting_data": ["2023_holiday_performance", "channel_attribution"],

**Agent Unavailable**:
```json
{
  "error": "agent_unavailable",
  "fallback_options": ["wait_for_agent", "route_to_alternative", "skip_analysis"],
  "estimated_wait": "5_minutes",
  "alternative_agents": ["marketing-agent-backup"]
}
```

**Attestation Failure**:
```json
{
  "error": "attestation_failed",
  "security_action": "terminate_collaboration",
  "escalation": "human_review_required",
  "audit_logged": true
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Caching Strategy
**Collaboration Result Caching**:
- Cache frequent collaboration patterns
- Store specialist analysis for reuse
- Invalidate cache on data updates
- Context-aware cache keys

**Cache Examples**:
```
"marketing_roi_analysis_Q4_budget_constraints" → Cached marketing analysis
"financial_impact_acquisition_scenarios" → Cached M&A financial models
"sales_forecast_seasonal_adjustments" → Cached sales projections
```

### 2. Load Balancing
**Agent Workload Distribution**:
- Track agent response times and load
- Route requests to least-loaded capable agents
- Implement backpressure for overloaded agents
- Scale agent instances based on demand

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
**Collaboration Chain Protection**:
- Detect failing agents and route around them
- Prevent cascade failures in collaboration chains
- Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
- Automatic recovery when agents return to health
