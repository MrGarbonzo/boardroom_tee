## üéØ Quick Reference

### Core Innovation
**Agent-to-Agent Collaborative Network** - Dynamic multi-specialist analysis without fixed pipeline overhead

### Value Proposition
- **Privacy-first access to ALL company data** with TEE guarantees
- **Specialized departmental agents** with cross-domain collaboration
- **Multi-specialist intelligence** at lower cost than traditional consulting

### Technical Stack
- **Hub**: Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct for data organization + agent orchestration
- **Spokes**: Specialized AI agents (Finance, Marketing, Sales, CEO)
- **Security**: SecretVM Verifiable Message Signing + Distributed Attestation
- **Communication**: Attested messaging with encrypted agent-to-agent protocols
- **APIs**: Complete REST API with JWT authentication and error handling

### Deployment Model
- Each client gets dedicated VM instances for complete data isolation
- Hub-spoke architecture with dynamic agent scaling
- Attestation-verified secure communication between all components
